FileSharing
===========

File Sharing system - Peer to Peer / Client - Server architecture hybrid
#currently working only on UB CS servers

* Clients connect to server and receive a list of already connected users
* Clients are able to exchange files (download, upload) from multiple peers at the same time


P.S - Requirement was to keep everything in one file. I might break it up to pieces for better organization soon.
